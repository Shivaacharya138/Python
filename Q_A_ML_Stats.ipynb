High bias indicates that the model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns.

A model with high variance, on the other hand, overfits the training data, capturing noise and idiosyncrasies. Finding the right balance between bias and variance is crucial for optimal model performance. As one decreases, the other increases.
